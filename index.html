<p>Through great trials and tribulations you've found yourself here.  The holy grail of.. wait.. this isn't the set of an adventure movie.  However, the Solomon reference holds weight - just ask me about my heritage.  It's pretty bad ass.  You're here to laugh at my attempt to programming - not my witty banter.</p>

<a id="seriously-though-a-tad-bit-about-myself" class="anchor" href="#seriously-though-a-tad-bit-about-myself" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Seriously though, a tad bit about myself.</h3>

<p>I thrive of all things DIY.  More so, the reward that comes from doing something for the first time I have zero experience in, being enamored by the possible uphill at hand and yet conquer all the same.  If there is a challenge then you've essentially obtained my interest.  With today's technology there is a tutorial out there for how to (insert anything, literally anything here). My favorite example of this is when I brought a friend's pool back to life..?  Perhaps, given the story.. I actually killed it?  So, she had left the pool unattended for months on end.  To the point it was deep swamp green with thousands of tad poles nipping at the bud to grow legs and hop away.  She was terrified of frogs, apparently.  I told her "Yeah I can definitely make this a pool again!" even though I had zero experience maintaining a pool other than watching my mother measure the pH levels from whence I was a child.  So, three weeks later, lots of chemicals and the genocide of an ecosystem - she had a crystal clear pool.  Technically, it's now dead.  You know why the waters in certain areas of paradise are crystal clear?  It's because there is no microbial life.</p>

<p>I also fancy any form of technology, cooking (father was a Chef and I spent the past twelve years as a professional server), SPACE (Asking me anything astronomy related is like opening Pandora's Box.. be warned), horticulture and a slew of other things.</p>

<p>I'm a half-glass full kind of person.  There's always a silver lining to any situation and rarely a finish line in sight.  I'm starting to feel like this is a bio for a dating website?</p>

<p>Anyways, like anyone, there's a lot more I could put here but for now -&gt; let's get git'n.</p>
