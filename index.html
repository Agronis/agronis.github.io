<p>Through great trials and tribulations you've found yourself here.  The holy grail of.. wait.. this isn't the set of an adventure movie.  However, the Solomon reference holds weight - just ask me about my heritage.  It's pretty bad ass.  You're here to to stalk my github - not be abused by my witty banter.</p>

<p>I thrive of all things DIY.  More so, the reward that comes from doing something for the first time I have zero experience in, being enamored by the possible uphill at hand and yet conquer all the same.  If there is a challenge then you've essentially obtained my interest.  With today's technology there is a tutorial out there for how to (insert anything, literally anything here).</p>

<p>I also fancy any form of technology, cooking (father was a Chef and I spent the past twelve years as a professional server), SPACE (Asking me anything astronomy related is like opening Pandora's Box.. be warned), horticulture and a slew of other things.</p>

<p>I'm a half-glass full kind of person.  There's always a silver lining to any situation and rarely a finish line in sight.  I'm starting to feel like this is a bio for a dating website?</p>

<p>Anyways, like anyone, there's a lot more I could put here but for now -&gt; let's get git'n.</p>
